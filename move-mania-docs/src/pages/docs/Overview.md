# Overview of Zion Bets

Zion Bets provides a smooth, mobile gambling experience on the Aptos blockchain.

## Why Zion Bets Stands Out

**Instant Account Funding:** Jump straight into the action. No complex wallet setups—just simple, straightforward fun.  

**Non-Custodial Betting:** We never hold your funds. All bets are processed on-chain, ensuring that you're always in control.  

**Competitive Fee Structure:** Enjoy zero fees on bets and minimal fees for liquidity providers, maximizing your returns on every wager.

### Decentralized Liquidity and Revenue Sharing

Zion Bets is truly decentralized. Anyone can act as the house and provide liquidity to our platform. In return, they receive a share of the casino's revenue. This is fully transparent, with every transaction and the liquidity pool's performance visible to all participants. This level of openness is unprecedented in on-chain casinos, where such details are typically obscured or unavailable.

### Superior Mobile User Experience

Zion Bets is designed for mobile and implemented as a Progressive Web App. Users can sign in easily using Gmail, thanks to Aptos’s zk-keyless technology, which will soon expand to include FaceID and phone number login options. Signing transactions are also abstracted away from the user, so they can perform quick bets with a single click.

### Security and Fairness with Move

At the heart of Zion Bets is our commitment to security and fairness, powered by Move on Aptos. Unlike other onchain casinos that use less secure or tested frameworks, our smart contracts and game logic are built in Move, ensuring top-tier security and robustness. This choice not only enhances the safety of user funds and integrity of game outcomes but also solidifies our platform's standing as a leader in secure, decentralized gambling.

### Fast, Secure, and Transparent Betting

Zion Bets leverages the Aptos blockchain, renowned for its high throughput and low latency, to offer an ultra-fast betting experience without sacrificing security. Our smart contracts undergo rigorous audits and incorporate sophisticated safety features that safeguard all transactions.

### Engage, Bet, and Earn

Zion Bets isn’t just for betting—it’s for engaging and earning. Players can interact within games, compete on leaderboards, and chat live with friends, all while betting on a graph-based interface that mirrors financial trading applications. This approach not only enhances the thrill of gambling but also integrates social elements that enrich the user experience.
